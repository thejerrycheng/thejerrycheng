## Employment History

### UofT Institution of Aerospace Studies, University of Toronto, Canada
*Research Assistant (Sep 2021 - Current)*  
Developed novel state estimation algorithms for 2D-mm-wave radar pairs and 3D-radar-to-camera extrinsic calibrations for autonomous vehicle development and onboard sensor calibration. Improved algorithm accuracy by 2-3 times compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### BOE Technology Group Co, Beijing, China
*Software Engineer Intern (May 2021 - July 2021)*  
Developed and trained two CNN neural networks using TensorFlow and PyTorch to distinguish pedestrian features. Enhanced overall accuracy from 64% to 89% by doubling the usable data for machine training through web crawlers.

### China State Shipbuilding Corporation, Shanghai, China
*Mechanical Engineer Intern (Sep 2020 - April 2021)*  
Assisted in designing the HVAC system layout for a 12-deck cruise ship. Designed and patented a high-pressure spray nozzle and associated fire pipeline system, achieving significant water and time savings in CFD simulations.

### Autodesk, Toronto, ON, Canada
*Student Ambassador (Sep 2019 - June 2020)*  
Founded the Fusion Design Association Club, trained over 30 students on generative design tools, and organized a 3D-printed glider competition.

## Highlighted Projects

- **Autonomous Rover Student Team - ROS Team Lead**  
Developed a SLAM algorithm for an autonomous rover using stereo cameras and lidars. Led a team of over 10 people to integrate mechanical, embedded, and CV aspects for global competition.

- **Turtlebot2 Localization, Mapping, Navigation, and Image Recognition Algorithm on ROS - Leader**  
Implemented Frontier Exploration and PID controller for robot exploration and path-following. Designed the control architecture using Gmapping, AMCL, OpenCV, and simulated on Gazebo, visualized on Rviz.

- **KUKA Manipulator’s Inverse Kinematic, Path Planning, and Control - Lab Member**  
Programmed inverse kinematics and path planning optimization algorithms for PUMA and KUKA robots. Achieved obstacle avoidance, end-effector calibrations, and path planning.

- **Unicycle Robot’s Design and Control**  
Developed a novel lightweight chassis design for a 2DOF unicycle robot using generative design. Customized the controller board with STM32 and completed real-life control system testing on ROS Gazebo and Simulink.
