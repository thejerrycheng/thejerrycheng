# Jerry (Qilong) Cheng

I build intelligent robotic systems that unify **perception, locomotion, and manipulation**.  
My work spans **reinforcement learning**, **humanoid & exoskeleton control**, and **robot design** (QDD, differential drives, custom 6-DOF arms).  
Currently a Ph.D. student in Robotics at **New York University**.

## Research Focus
- **RL for locomotion & loco-manipulation** (humanoids, rockets, exoskeletons)  
- **Model-based + data-driven control** in musculoskeletal and rigid-body systems  
- **Robot design**: QDD actuators, differential drives, lightweight cinema arms  
- **Perception for control**: monocular depth, radar–camera calibration, real-time estimation

## Selected Projects
- **IRIS** — lightweight 6-DOF cinema robot arm (custom QDD actuators + differential wrist)  
- **MoE-based RL controllers** for adaptive hip exoskeletons in musculoskeletal simulation  
- **Humanoid × Human gait benchmarking** for locomotion evaluation (NYU)  
- **Globally optimal radar–camera calibration** (Kelly Lab, UTIAS)  
- **Spatialized vibrotactile systems** for teleoperation & HCI (Wigdor Lab)
